Cambridge English offers a range of very nice examinations for learners of English as a second language. I personally have been preparing students to take their Young Learners (YLE) for a quite a few years now. They publish lists of vocabulary that students should know at each level, but I've only ever found it in hardcopy or PDF formats, like this one:

I wanted to make a version of this list that teachers could more easily use when creating resources for their students, so I put together the Cambridge YLE Vocabulary Dataset.

If you're in a hurry, here's a link the GitHub repo with a `csv` file, if you know what to do with that:

And here's a link to a Google Sheet that you make a copy of and perhaps query more easily using just filter views:

When crafting lessons to prepare for the examinations, did you ever want a list of all the Movers nouns with irregular plurals? How about a list of all the words that are different between British and American English? A list of words related to animals and the natural world? Well, that'll be a lot easier now.
