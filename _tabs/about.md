Welcome to the blog for [CrayonFox](https://crayonfox.com), which is a nascent software development company focusing on apps for students and teachers. My name's Chris and I'll be the primary author here. You can send me an email, if you'd like, at <contact@crayonfox.com>. I'm also active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/this-is-chris/) and [Github](https://github.com/ozbonus).
